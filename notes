Ordering:

da-1,da-2,da-3
relay,exit,client

So basically - it's all about the DAs

--

ALL

Nickname
Address (Though can't we use 0.0.0.0?)
ControlPort (but isn't it the same for everyone?)
HashedControlPassword (again, same for everyone)

DA

cat /etc/tor/torrc.da >> /etc/tor/torrc
OrPort
DirPort
ExitPolicy
tor-gencert STUFF

(!!) torrc.da FOR OTHERS

RELAY/EXIT
OrPort
DirPort
ExitPolicy

EVERYONE gets torrcd.da which I guess is what tells them where the DAs are

Notes..

1) In his world DAs aren't scalable (fine by me!)

So can we just do all the generation of config files offline beforehand?
To begin with can't I just hardcode that stuff???

2) he uses IPs everywhere, we should use hostnames (which means we can hard code that shti!! yayy!!!!!)
